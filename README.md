# RequestPolicy (continued)

## About RequestPolicy

RequestPolicy is a Firefox extension that gives you control over cross-site
requests. It does this through user-defined whitelists and blacklists. Users
can also subscribe to policies (whitelists and blacklists) maintained by
others.

For more information about RequestPolicy and cross-site requests, have a look at our website:
https://requestpolicycontinued.github.io/requestpolicy/

## This project

The RequestPolicy "Continued" project is a fork of
[RequestPolicy](https://github.com/RequestPolicy/requestpolicy), which had been
developed by [Justin Samuel](https://github.com/jsamuel) until 2012. Currently we aim at releasing our first stable version – 1.0 – but there is still much to do. If you want to be informed about this milestone, you could subscribe to [this issue](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues/446). If you're interested, [here](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/milestones/1.0)  you can find a list of all open issues for version 1.0.
