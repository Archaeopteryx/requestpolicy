# RequestPolicy (continued)

RequestPolicy is a Firefox extension that gives you control over cross-site
requests. It does this through user-defined whitelists and blacklists. Users
can also subscribe to policies (whitelists and blacklists) maintained by
others.

For more information about RequestPolicy and cross-site requests, see
https://www.requestpolicy.com

The RequestPolicy "Continued" project is in fact a fork of RequestPolicy,
which had been [developed by Justin Samuel (jsamuel) until 2012](https://github.com/RequestPolicy/requestpolicy).
To continue development, this fork has been created. Note that we're using the same
name for the software itself, "RequestPolicy", and we continue the version
numbering.
