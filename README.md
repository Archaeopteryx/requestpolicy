# RequestPolicy (continued)

RequestPolicy is a Firefox extension that gives you control over cross-site
requests. It does this through user-defined whitelists and blacklists. Users
can also subscribe to policies (whitelists and blacklists) maintained by
others.

For more information about RequestPolicy and cross-site requests, have a look at
https://requestpolicycontinued.github.io/requestpolicy/

The RequestPolicy "Continued" project is in fact a fork of
[RequestPolicy](https://github.com/RequestPolicy/requestpolicy), which had been
developed by [Justin Samuel](https://github.com/jsamuel) until 2012.
To continue development, this fork has been created. Note that we're using the
same name for the software itself, "RequestPolicy", and we continue the version
numbering.
